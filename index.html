    <p>
        Something that worked well for me in the last 9 weeks in my learning process was the structure of the class. 
        Having the PowerPoint lecture followed by a demo was the best way I could have had it set up for me to learn.

        I don't think there's anything about the course I would change. I felt it went really smoothly.

        I learned what I expected to learn and more in this course. I didn't have much of an idea of what I would be 
        getting into, but most of it was really interesting. Some of it however, not so much. I only say that because 
        some things were just a little harder for me to grasp, so it wasn't fun for me immediately.

        Some new concepts that were presented to me were the CSS and Bootstrap grids. I already knew about Bootstrap 
        from the HTML portion of the course, but learning about the grid and how to manipulate it was new and interesting. 
        Some concepts I had already encountered in the past, was probably the accessability course things. We had gotten so
        many little lectures about it throughout the course that when the dedicated one came around, it mostly seemed like 
        review.
